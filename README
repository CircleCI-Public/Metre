Metre :: An XMPP Server

  |  There once was a server called Metre,
  |  Which talked by a method by Peter,
  |  Saint-Andre and others:
  |  The XSF Brothers!
  |  Much more than a stanza repeater.

Metre (check that spelling) is an XMPP Server.

It's written in C++11 (ie, modern C++), and aims to include all the
bells and whistles that a modern server requires. It's is a "Post RFC
6120" server - that is, it wasn't started until well after 6120 was
published, and so has little or no legacy code, or support for,
ancient clients.
